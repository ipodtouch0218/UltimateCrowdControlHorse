# PLEASE NOTE
**THIS MOD IS A HEAVY WORK IN PROGRESS**

# Ultimate Crowd Control Horse

A crowd control mod for Ultimate Chicken Horse!

> But doesn't UCH already have the Twitch integration mode?

Yes! But it's not that interactive! This is better!
This mod allows users to place items using the website (or your own, if
you wish to self-host...)

Obviously, this is unfinished. I'm still working on it, calm down.
Currently, all clients require the mod even though it feasably could
be a host-only mod. I dunno, I tried to make it host-only, man. More
documentation will be coming soon. Ish.
